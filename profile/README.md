## Welcome to the Wyatt Lab!

We are research group located in Vancouver, Canada at the University of British Columbia. We study both liquid (i.e., ctDNA) and tissue biopsies, using novel bioinformatic techniques to discover and validate new biomarkers and to better understand therapy resistance and cancer evolution. You can learn more about our research on our [website](https://blogs.ubc.ca/wyattlab/).

In the future, here you will be able to find some of our computational pipelines that have been used in publications.
